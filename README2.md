Top hits Musics on Hold of IVR solutions:
The biggest complaint from customers when they call a company is being on hold. Most companies optimize and customize the IVR and music on hold is always that boring thing.
A customer who is impatient on hold can abandon the call and call again at another time. This incurs a cost to the company. Ideally, the customer waits in line and resolves their issue, so they don't have to call again later.
There is a study that says that an impatient customer would be much more willing to wait in line if their experience during the wait is pleasant.
The project aims to provide this positive experience to the customer, bringing considerable savings to the business and adding value to the customer experience.
Summing up the project, during the customer's wait there will be a service that plays snippets of songs that were considered top hits from the person's transition phase to adulthood. This will bring pleasant memories to the customer, making him wait in line and will even be less bothered to have waited and may reduce the harshness with the attendant.
